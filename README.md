# Vulnerable chess game
A simple vulnerable Chess Game developed in Java, using also javascript, jsp pages, css and traditional HttpRequest and HttpReponse.
It uses a mysql database with info of the users.

You can find some SQL Injections, Cross Site Scripting, Path Traversal and so on.
Some of the most important OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities.

## Steps to deploy the application locally

### Generating war file with gradle
    gradle clean
    gradle buildImage

You have also the option to generate a image with obfuscated source code, it uses proguard for java as obfuscator.
To do that, simply run.
    
    gradle buildImageObf

### Generating war file with maven
    mvn clean install -Dp.type=war

### Deploying the application with Docker
Now that you have your war file generated you can deploy your application with Docker.
To do that run:

#### Deploying the application itself
    docker run -d --name chess -p 8087:8080 sebastianrevuelta/chess-game:2.3

#### Deploying a mysql database with docker
    docker run -d -p 3306:3306 --name mysql_db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD={PASSWORD} --mount src=mysql-db-data,dst=/var/lib/mysql mysql

**Note: Credentials, host and port of the database should be configured in resources/config.properties file before war generation**

### Deploying the application with Docker Compose
After building the image (gradle buildImage command) then you can deploy with docker-compose as follow:
    
    docker-compose up -d

### Populate database

    docker exec -i mysql_db sh -c 'exec mysql -uroot -p{password}' < ./sql/chess_db.sql
    
You can access to the application through:

    localhost:8087/chess

## Steps to deploy the application in Azure Cloud

In order to deploy the application in Microsoft Azure Cloud, we need to follow the next steps:

1. Install maven plugin 

       <plugin> 
        <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>  
        <artifactId>azure-webapp-maven-plugin</artifactId>  
        <version>1.7.0</version>  
       </plugin>
    
2. Generate azure configuration
    
       mvn azure-webapp:config
    
3. Deploy the application in azure

       mvn azure-webapp:deploy 
  (you should generate the war file as explained above)
  
### How to see the logs in Azure
First of all, you need to download the Axure CLI client.
Then you can check the logs as this:
  
      az webapp log tail --name {appName} --resource-group {groupName}

  **Note: You can use a MySQL database as a Azure Service, in any case, you need to configure credentials, host and port of the database in resources/config.properties file before deploying app**
  
 ## Pending improvements
 * Extract chess engine as microservice
 * Configuration properties file as environment variables
